  "body": "### What is this about?\r\nThis page allows you to memorize your password in short time. Just set your own password (stored in your browser's local storage, of course!) and come back and try typing it in again. The JavaScript will show the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) (the amount of typing errors), and optionally reveals your saved password. Every time you open your computer, open the page and challenge yourself until you know it. Congratulations, you can now use your password with confidence!\r\n\r\n### What do I need to run this?\r\nYou need the HTML file and the js and css folder. Open the HTML file with your browser. If you trust this github repository, you might also use this online version.",
